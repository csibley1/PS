Some early powershell scripts I wrote to make life a little easier at work. Descriptions below:

000_user_setup -- Creates a new user in AD and O365 with some interaction.

001_user_setup -- Creates a new user automatically when a new hire form is received in the monitored mailbox.

ITToolbox -- All-in-one script that handles various lookup tasks in AD and a computer list spreadsheet.

set-DriversNHostname -- Computer setup script that installs drivers, sets initial local admin password, and disables FastBoot.
